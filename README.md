# TEC-1 Stochastic Addon for Numerical Integration

## Introduction

This project implements **numerical integration** using the **trapezoidal rule** on the TEC-1, enhanced with **stochastic computation** techniques. The trapezoidal rule is a classical numerical method used to estimate the area under a curve by dividing it into trapezoids. In this project, the integration focuses on the function:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}
\]

### Key Variables
- `a`, `b`: Lower and upper limits of the integral.
- `n`: Number of sub-intervals.
- `h`: Step size, calculated as \( h = \frac{b - a}{n} \).
- `x[]`, `y[]`: Arrays for storing values of `x` and `y`.
- `s`: Sum of \( f(x) \) values at the sub-interval points.
- `inte`: The final result of the integration.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Input Handling:**  
   The user is prompted to enter the lower limit (`a`), upper limit (`b`), and the number of sub-intervals (`n`).

2. **Trapezoidal Rule Setup:**  
   The step size `h` is calculated, and the values of `x` and `y` are computed for each sub-interval.

3. **Summation:**  
   The sum `s` accumulates \( f(x) \) values for the sub-intervals.

4. **Final Calculation:**  
   The final integral is estimated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Integral} = \frac{h}{2} \times \left( y[0] + y[n] + 2 \times s \right)
   \]

   This formula approximates the area under the curve.

### Code Breakdown

Here’s the structure of the code in **Mint**, adapted for numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule:

```mint
:main
    20 m !                                 // Set 'm' (max size) to 20

    // Prompt user for input
    `Enter lower limit, upper limit, and number of subintervals: ` /N

    /K a !                                 // Store user input in 'a' (lower limit)
    /K b !                                 // Store user input in 'b' (upper limit)
    /K n !                                 // Store user input in 'n' (number of intervals)

    // Calculate h = (b - a) / n
    b a - n / h !

    // Allocate memory for arrays 'x' and 'y'
    m /A x !                                // Allocate space for 'x' array
    m /A y !                                // Allocate space for 'y' array

    // Initialize x[0] = a
    a x 0 + !                              // Set x[0] to 'a'

    // Initialize y[0] = 1 / (1 + x[0]^2)
    x 0 ? dup * 1 + 1 / y 0 + !            // Compute y[0]

    // Print headers
    `x y` /N

    1 i !                                   // Set loop counter i to 1

    // Main loop for x[i] and y[i] calculations
    /U (
        i n < /W                           // Loop until i >= n
        i 1 - x 0 + ? h + x i !            // Calculate x[i]
        x i ? dup * 1 + 1 / y i !          // Calculate y[i]
        i 1 + i !                          // Increment i
    )

    // Reset loop counter i and initialize sum
    1 i !
    0 s !

    // Loop for summing y[1] to y[n-1]
    /U (
        i n < /W                           // Loop until i >= n
        y i ? s + s !                      // Sum y[i]
        i 1 + i !                          // Increment i
    )

    // Calculate the integral
    y 0 ? y n ? + 2 s * + h * 2 / inte !

    // Print the result
    `The value of the integral is ` inte . /N

## Stochastic Computing Perspective

Although this project is focused on traditional numerical methods like the trapezoidal rule, it’s essential to clarify **stochastic computing**. In stochastic computing, numbers are represented as **probabilistic bit streams**, and operations are performed using simple logic gates. This approach is different from classical numerical integration, which directly manipulates fixed-point or floating-point numbers.

### Incorporating Stochastic Elements:
1. **Random Sampling:**  
   If the integration is extended with **Monte Carlo methods**, random sampling of function values could be used to estimate the integral.
   
2. **Bit Stream Operations:**  
   In a stochastic computing system, the values of `x`, `y`, and their corresponding operations would be encoded in probabilistic bit streams, which are then manipulated using logic operations.

## Conclusion

This project on **numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule** for TEC-1 provides an excellent foundation for understanding basic numerical methods. While it doesn't incorporate **stochastic computing**, extending the project to include Monte Carlo methods or bit stream operations would be a valuable next step if needed.
