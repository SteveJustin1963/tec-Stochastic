### Exploration into stochastic computing 
- encode integers values into long fixed length bit streams mixed with random bits
- build gates that represent
  - boolean logic 
  - analog logic
  - quantum logic
  - other, explore
  - control gates, like mux demux, switching etc
- io select gates
- count the o/p of the gates into a 32bit counter chip
- control with tec-1 and mint
- test against a variety of maths problems, eg trapezoidal integration etc
- consider the fit and use of Monte Carlo sampling
- consider issues 
  - very large numbers requiring specific approaches. ie scaling or log-based methods
  - negative numbers
  - overflow and carry
